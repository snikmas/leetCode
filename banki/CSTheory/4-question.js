// What is an algorithm?
// An algorithm is an instruction step-by-step for solving a particular problem

// Key Points:
// Input- An algorithm must possess 0 or more well-defined inputs supplied externally to the algorithm.
// Output- An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs as desired.
// Correctness- Every step of the algorithm must generate a correct output.
// Definiteness-Algorithms should be clear and unambiguous, thus every step of the algorithm should be clear and well defined.
// Finiteness- The algorithm should have a finite number of steps that must be carried out to achieve the task at hand.
