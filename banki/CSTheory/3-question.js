// What are types (js)?

// Types in Js are different categories of values that variables can hold; Js is a dynamically typed language, means that variables can hold any type of data and the type can change during runtime

// JS has 7 built-in data types: 
// 1. Primitive Types
// Number; String; Boolean; Undefined (was declared but not assigned); Null; Symbol and Bigint
// 2. Object Types: Object (collection of key-value pairs/arrays/functions/dates/etc) and Function(special kind of it, can be invoked/called)
